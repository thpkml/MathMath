# MathMath
Simple Java Math Game for kids
## Usage
Feel free to use the code for: 
- learning how to build your own simple math game by customising the code
- build a version for yourself without modifying the code.  
Do remember to share if you make one.  
**Note:** The application is not a lesson on the Object Oriented nature of Java.  
All code is written in a single file without any consideration on classing and subclassing.  
This is a simple example of using programming **logic** to solve fun problems. 

The written code is in the file src/com/mathmath/start/MathMath.java
